      "looking for help, from fellow lonely people. hey there guys and gals. so, the past year and a bit has been more than very rough on me. . i came to a lot of realizations that a lot of people that surround me are just using me for their own good and they don't really care about me that much. at first it hurt really bad, but you know, as the days went by i just understood that well. . it's just how it is, and for a long time i was okay with the fact that i am completely alone and i don't have any friends, but for the past few weeks it really started to hit me. the thing is, when i was a teenager (now i am 23) i was always surrounded by people, everyone were inviting me to hang out and i just got used to being around people all the time, thus now it's getting more and more difficult day-by-day, as i don't even remember when i had a conversation with a person which i can trust. . #x200b;now i am writing with a reason. i need your help, people. i know that there are a lot of people who are feeling lonely, but i feel that there are a lot of kind humans that overcame the loneliness and they are doing a lot better, even if they are completely alone. i need your advice, i finally want to fight this terrible feeling, but i am completely lost and i don't know where should i start. i tried to search for a solution everywhere but you know, i got mostly basic answers such as \"join some sort of a class, get a new hobby and all that stuff\" but these things won't really help, and i know that for a fact, as i have a fairly decent job, with colleagues that i can chat with for hours, but that's not the thing i wish for. . i wish to have at least one true friend, which i could trust, and these things are not that simple, as you can't build a friendship in one day, and all my old pals are long gone from my life. so i am in a search for a way to overcome that urge to have at least one friend, and that's why i am asking for your help. #x200b;so, the question: what is the best way to overcome loneliness? please share your ideas, experiences and suggestions if you can. i know that i won't find a solution here, as every human being is living out a different situation, but i want to start somewhere. after many hours (days/months) of thinking and settling down everything in my head, i am completely fine with the fact that i don't have any friends, but that feeling of emptiness is hurting me so bad, that it is fairly difficult to ignore it. thank you all who will take a minute to give their ideas, i appreciate you all. \n",

      "vent  there's probably no point to this, and i'll probably delete this post, but for this moment at least i have to spill my thoughts out.  i'm fucking dying from loneliness, isolation, and boredom. for context, i do have social anxiety and while that has made me do extreme things at times (literally run out of a gym because they needed a picture of me), i'm basically functional. i'm in grad school and have a job. when i'm in those settings and have something to talk about, i can talk. there's other situations where i'm basically okay, but when it comes to just being conversational with a stranger for no reason, i can't do it.  not that any of that even matters. i have tried everything i can possibly do on my end of things to make friends and nothing has worked. the key word here is friends. i've never had much trouble finding a boyfriend (if you're an okay-looking girl and are on tinder, it's really not hard to find a dude who'll take the time to get to know you because he knows he'll get to smash in the end. women ignore me though--bisexual/lesbian dating is like pulling teeth. but i digress). anyway, point is, i have a boyfriend, and we're basically attached at the hip, but it's not enough. he's desperate for friends too, and i want him to have that. we both deserve connections outside of each other. but with the way things are going, we might as well be the last two people on earth surrounded by vaguely people-looking things that sometimes talk to us but never connect with us.   before anyone starts hitting me with some advice i've already heard 10 billion times, let me just list everything i've tried to make friends/treat my social anxiety in order to make friends. 1. tinder2. bumble3. okcupid (back in the day when it was cool) 4. a writing meetup group5. a social anxiety/depression meetup group (might've worked out but it disbanded after like 2 meetings)6. my college's lgbt club 7. my college's vegan club8. activism9. volunteer work10. staying in shape/dressing well/basically looking good so people won't treat me like a goddamn leper 11. talked to a random person at my college's stupid 'heyday' event12. going to coffee shops/bars/etc alone and hoping to christ that some person just fucking acknowledges i exist (best result: an old couple felt sorry for me at the bar and talked to me for about five minutes before leaving).13. meditation 14. journaling15. mindfulness16. religion/spirituality17. focusing on myself and my hobbies so i don't spiral into this exact mood i'm having right now oh wait too late 18. four different therapists19. three different medications 20. and a partridge in a fucking pear tree  i hear you asking \"why didn't any of those things work out\". well, i'm a psych grad so going to therapy is like watching a play except the lights never go down, so you can see all the set pieces moving and all the costume changes. i know what they're going to say to me, and it's all redundant and unhelpful. as for the meds, i don't know, i'm not a med person. they just didn't work.   the social stuff mainly boils down to living in a shitty fucking southern state in the year of our lord 2019 where no one looks up from their fucking phones, so even the people who aren't socially anxious don't know how to talk to anyone anymore, and even if they did talk to me, we'd have nothing in common because my beliefs are so radically different from everyone else's (except my boyfriend, the one person in the world who agrees with me on anything). i definitely don't fit in with the conservative majority, but i don't fit in with the liberals or anyone else either.   there are so many things i can't talk about with people or have no interest in talking about. like i can't talk about politics because of the aforementioned differences in beliefs (and i mean major differences, and no, i don't want to 'discuss our differences' because i've tried that shit and it just leads to arguments and i know no one's mind is going to change anyway so its a huge headache and waste of time).   i also can't talk about a lot of innocuous surface-level stuff because quite frankly, i don't care about the fucking office or game of thrones or snapchat or whatever the fuck everyone is so obsessed with. oh, just talk about my interests then? sure, let me bore you to death with my comparison of three different versions of victor hugo's *notre dame de paris*, and ooohhh you're already out the door. do i have any popular interests? sure, i'm into *star wars*, but probably not the way you're into it. how? oh, nothing, it's just the sequel trilogy is my favorite and----oh, bad opinion alert, off you go!   i'm trying to accept that all the love i'll ever have is between me and my partner. i know i'm lucky to even have that, and i shouldn't ask for anything more, but that doesn't stop me from crying at least three times a week because he's busy at work and i'm home alone with nothing to do and no one to see and nothing else to live for. i'm really not looking for advice here, because i seriously don't think there's anything left for me to try. i just wanted to spill my guts into the void and be angry and lame and feel sorry for myself, i guess. whatever. you can make fun of me if you want or tell me i'm being \"negative\". have at it. i don't care.   sorry you had to read this, if you made it this far. hope your life is going better than mine, that you have popular interests, popular opinions, and live somewhere cool where things happen and people aren't all carbon copies of each other constantly chanting \"it gets better\" with no proof that it actually does.   peace. \n",

Each attempt at conversation, each effort to engage, seems to fall short, leaving me more disheartened. It's a cycle of seeking and hoping, only to be met with the cold reality of solitude. The more I try, the more apparent my isolation becomes, and the more I wonder if there’s something about me that just doesn’t resonate with others.\",\n",

    "    \"Being in a crowd is a strange experience for me. I’m surrounded by people, yet I’ve never felt more isolated. It's like being adrift in a sea of faces, voices, and emotions, yet not being a part of any of it. I watch as others interact and connect, forming bonds and sharing moments, while I remain just an observer. This feeling of isolation isn't just about being physically alone; it's about feeling disconnected and unseen, even in the midst of a bustling crowd.\",\n",

    "    \"Nighttime is the hardest for me. As the world quiets down, I'm left alone with my thoughts, which often turn into a whirlpool of loneliness and reflection. The darkness of the night seems to mirror the darkness of my mood. These are the hours when the feeling of solitude is most acute, and my mind relentlessly revisits moments of the day, analyzing and overthinking. The silence of the night is a stark reminder of my solitude, a time when I’m left to confront my deepest feelings of isolation and longing for connection.\"\n",
